Air Quality Index: "Most Polluted Cities/Countries"
We found this dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/most-polluted-cities-and-countries-iqair-index?datasetId=2029905
This dataset was interesting because it had recent data between 2017-2021, which was "Pre-Covid/Post-Covid", and we were curious if there were any noticeable changes across various cities/countries in the air pollution.
A few questions we thought of were as follows:
What is the largest movement/transition in air quality index per country (pre-covid vs post covid)?
What countries have the greatest and least change over the time period in the dataset?
Does the Air Quality Index affect the average temperature over time?
Is there a correlation between life expectancy and air quality for the countries in the dataset?
