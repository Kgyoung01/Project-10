#Datasets

This dataset was interesting because it had recent data between 2017-2021, which was "Pre-Covid/Post-Covid", and we were curious if there were any noticeable changes across various cities/countries in the air pollution.
#Questions devleoped based on the datesets utilized:
1. What is the largest movement/transition in air quality index per country (pre-covid vs post covid)?
There was a 14% decrease between 2018 and 2021 in AQI for the dataset of 72 countries.
There was a slight increase in AQI in 2021 from 2020 when Covid-19 movement restrictions ended. 
2. Does the Air Quality Index affect the average temperature change(value)  over time?
Worldwide temperatures increased in our dataset 1.71 degrees in aggregate. 
There was no statistical correlation found between average temperature change and Air Quality Index
3. Is there a correlation between population and Air Quality Index?
Country populations and AQI did not have a statistical correlation after analysis.  
City population and AQI would be a more relevant analysis because it is more localized and a smaller geographic area to examine potential impact of population on AQI
4. Is there a correlation between life expectancy and Air Quality Index for the countries in the dataset?
There is a moderately stronq correlation between AQI and life expectancy where life expectancy generally increases as AQI decreases(air quality improves with lower AQI).  
This is relevant as having clean air to breath decreases the chance for sickness from respiratory ailments.

#Further research considerations
Review years prior to 2017 to further evaluate Pre-Covid/Post-Covid AQI
Continue to review temperature change Post-Covid (2020) to confirm if relationship can be established
No proven relationship between large population (country) & higher AQI can be established; will the same be proven if we researched population by cities?
Established relationship between AQI/Life Expectancy; are there other factors that may be influencers?
Further analysis on correlations between AQI and specific illnesses, especially respiratory ailments
